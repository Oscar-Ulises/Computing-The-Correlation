# Computing-The-Correlation
The next task was given for [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).

You are given the scores of N students in three different subjects - Mathematics,*Physics* and Chemistry; all of which have been graded on a scale of 0 to 100. Your task is to compute the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the scores of different pairs of subjects (Mathematics and Physics, Physics and Chemistry, Mathematics and Chemistry) based on this data. This data is based on the records of the CBSE K-12 Examination - a national school leaving examination in India, for the year 2013.

Output Format

The output should contain three lines, with correlation coefficients computed
and rounded off correct to exactly 2 decimal places.
The first line should contain the correlation coefficient between Mathematics and Physics scores.
The second line should contain the correlation coefficient between Physics and Chemistry scores.
The third line should contain the correlation coefficient between Chemistry and Mathematics scores.

So, your output should look like this (these values are only for explanatory purposes):
